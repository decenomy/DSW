Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - Qt GUI
 __Decenomy__ is a free, open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 18.5+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides __Decenomy__-Qt, a GUI for __Decenomy__ based on Qt.
